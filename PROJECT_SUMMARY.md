# Qalin Sara Inventory Management System

## Project Summary for Collaborators & Partners

---

### 🎯 The Problem

Small and medium-sized carpet retailers face significant challenges in managing their inventory efficiently. Traditional methods—spreadsheets, paper records, or generic retail software—fail to address the unique needs of carpet businesses:

- **Size Variants**: Carpets come in multiple sizes (2m to 12m), each requiring separate stock tracking and pricing
- **High-Value Inventory**: Carpets are expensive items requiring precise value tracking for financial planning
- **Visual Identification**: Buyers need to see product photos; text descriptions alone are insufficient
- **Multi-Currency Operations**: Many carpet businesses import internationally and sell locally

These challenges lead to stock discrepancies, missed sales opportunities, and inefficient business operations.
